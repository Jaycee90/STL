# STL
This part of the assignment aims at providing you with a programming exercise involving a linked list, stack, queue, and the STL.
Test your completed program with at least the supplied test input file (a5p2_test.in): make test (or, if you prefer to do it "manually", ./a5p2 auto < a5p2_test.in > a5p2_test.out).
